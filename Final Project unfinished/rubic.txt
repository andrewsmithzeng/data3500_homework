This project is similar to Stock market trading simulations, however you will run trading simulations on 6 crypto currencies(not 10) of your choice (i.e. bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, ripple, EOS, Litecoin, Ethereum)
Like the stock market project, you will get the price data from a web json API, and save it to csv files.  An example will be shown in class.
Your program will run two trading strategies(not 3) on the crypto currency prices.
Your program should be able to save new data into the files.  Meaning, when I go to run your program, it should go get the latest data, update the files, and run new analysis.
If your program detects a buy signal or sell signal on the last day in the data, print a message like “You should <buy or sell> this stock today”.
Store your results to your strategy in a results.json, and specifically identify which crypto currency and strategy made the most profit.Each project must meet the following 5 project requirements:

Obtaining data from a web JSON API (40 points)
Storing the data in CSV files (40 points)
The ability to add new data to your dataset.  
Meaning, tomorrow you can run your program again, and it will go get the latest data, and run your analysis again. (40 points)
Perform analysis on the data. (40 points)
Store your results in a results.json file (40 points)
