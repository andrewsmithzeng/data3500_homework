 2. make a variable called number_purchased (set it to whatever you want)
 3. make a variable called tax and set it equal to 1.07
 4. make a variable, total_bill and calculate it by: total_bill = apple_price * number_purchased * tax
 5. print clearly and cleanly how many apples were purchased and the total_bill
