Write a program which can adds up the numbers in the series:
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 for 1000 iterations.
create a variable for the denominator
for loop for 1000 iterations
start for loop at 1, go to 1000
variable to track the sum
What number is the result?

sum = 0
for i in range(1, 1001):
    sum += 1/(2**i)
print(sum)
