Programming Activity 1

Write a program which asks the user for two numbers, stored in two variables num1 and num2. 
Generate a multiplication table for all integers 1 through num1 and 1 through num2. 
The bottom right entry in your table should have the product of num1 and num2. 
The table must be stored in a 2D list. 
The list must be created first with a nested for loop. 
Then, the table should be printed by another nested for loop iterating through the 2D list.
Steps:
- store the variables.
- create a list, and add empty lists to the list - however many your need from the variables above.
- append the values to the lists.
- use a nested for loop to iterate through the list and print the values.
