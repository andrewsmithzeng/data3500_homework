Programming Activity 4 

Using the list you generated in programming activity 3, extend your program to check if there are 2 even numbers in a row. If there are two even numbers in a row, print the numbers.
- There's a few ways to approach this, you could:
      1. use the index operator: lst[count] and lst[count+1]
      2. use slice operator: lst[count:count+2]
      3. use separate to store previous or next, and check if those are even
- No matter which way you chose you need to:
- Each iteration in the loop check if the current number and next number are both even.
